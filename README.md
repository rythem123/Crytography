# Crytography
Prerequisites:

Language used – Python.
Tkinter – This module is used to make GUIs using python language. To know more about tkinter click here https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python-gui-tkinter/

Basics of Cryptography – Cryptography is used for Secure Communication.

Encryption – The process of encoding a message or information in such a way that only authorized parties can access it.

Decryption – The process of taking encoded or encrypted text or other data and converting it back into text.


Algorithm used

ONE-TIME PAD

The one-time pad is a type of encryption which is unbreakable. A one-time pad will generate a key, this key is shared by both the user so it does encryption as 
well as decryption. The key used is generated randomly and this key is combined with the plain text in order to form the ciphertext. We can use different algorithms for 
the generation of the ciphertext such as modular addition, modular XOR, etc.Since the key generated every time is unique, it is impossible to break.
